<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Harshit, and I'm the creator of the OpenAI Article Generator. With my PHP script, you can easily generate articles in just a few minutes. In this project, I utilized OpenAI's API to suggest keywords and generate articles based on user input.</p>

<h2>Login and Signup:</h2>
<p>The project starts with a login and signup process. Users can create a new account by signing up and verifying their email address with the email OTP verification system. Once they log in, they are redirected to the dashboard.</p>
<h2>Dashboard:</h2>
<p>In the dashboard, users can enter a title for their article, and the OpenAI API suggests up to 5 keywords related to the title. Users can select up to 5 keywords to generate the article.</p>
<h2>Article Generation:</h2>
<p>Once the user selects their keywords, the OpenAI API generates an article based on the input. The generated article is then displayed on the screen for the user to review.</p>
<h2>CSS and JS:</h2>
<p>The project's frontend is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The CSS folder includes a style.css file that defines the styling of the webpage, while the JS folder contains a main.js file that handles the frontend functionality of the project.</p>
<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p>In conclusion, My OpenAI Article Generator is a useful tool for users who need to generate articles quickly and efficiently. The integration of OpenAI's API and the inclusion of email OTP verification provide a secure and reliable solution for article generation.
